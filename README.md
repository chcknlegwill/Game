# Game - Name TBD
This is just a start into making a game with C++

# how to run / install
1. Download the repository
2. install dependencies (use the repsective package manager for your system e.g. pacman > arch, ):
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libglew-dev libglm-dev libassimp-dev zlib1g-dev`
^ this will be improved, but I do not need to release anything for user-consumption as it is still very, very early stages of development.
